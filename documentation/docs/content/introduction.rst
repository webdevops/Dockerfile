What are the Dockerfile for?
----------------------------

The Dockerfile repository is reponsible for generating our Docker images on https://hub.docker.com/u/webdevops/.

We're generating Docker images for PHP, Apache, Nginx, Varnish or Sphinx.

All Docker images are generated by our Build server at https://build.webdevops.io/.
